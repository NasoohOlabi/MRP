read the @Wartaqi.csv this course is way more simple essensially I have students I take their first name last name and birth year and only their phone number

each student has a teacher
I need to take attendance 
 each student has a level you can consider it `class` 1-2-3-4
each student is entitled to one notebook per class so if he's 1 and has class if he graduate 1 he's entited to a new notebook

import the data from the csv into the db
